faqs:
  - question: Do you charge by the hour?
    answer: We avoid billing by the hour whenever it’s possible. It creates
      ambiguity and makes you worry about your upcoming CPA bill. The only time
      we are billing by the hour is when we cannot reasonably estimate our time
      spend on a specific non-recurring project.
  - answer: " We will be more than happy to meet you in person if you are in San
      Diego area. If not, we try to set up Zoom meetings for all of our new
      customers. Also, California CPAs can be verified on the CBA website. You
      are welcome to look us up! We are in compliance. "
    question: Can I meet you in person? Afterall, you have my personal information!
  - question: How do you deliver sensitive information to clients?
    answer: We are paperless and virtual. We utilize a secure client portal to
      exchange and deliver private information. Client documents are
      encrypted  and stored on a secure server with two-factor authentication.
  - question: Can you prepare my 1040?
    answer: "Yes we can! However, please keep in mind that individual tax
      preparation is not included in our business plans offered above. "
  - question: Do you require a retainer?
    answer: We don’t ask for a retainer as long as you came to us from a different
      cannabis CPA firm. We trust our colleagues and believe in their accounting
      expertise. However, if prior to us you were doing your own accounting, or
      you are just starting out, we will ask for the retainer because of the
      amount of work that will be required to set up or clean up your
      accounting.
  - answer: First, we work from home and keep our expenses lean. Second, cannabis
      startups pay huge taxes and they need CPAs with expert knowledge of 280E
      mitigation. Accounting firms are aware of your tax situation and use it to
      their advantage by artificially inflating their accounting rates. We don’t
      do that. We base our pricing on the amount of expected work and not your
      despair. Our rate is $150 an hour, and it is a standard rate for a small
      CPA firm anywhere in the US. If we think that your business requires 5-6
      hours of monthly CPA work, we will offer you our Basic Plan. The more
      hours we plan to spend on your accounting, the higher our monthly fee will
      be. If we later find out that we grossly under or overestimated required
      work hours, we will adjust our bill accordingly.
    question: Why are you so inexpensive?
