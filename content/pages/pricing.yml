faqs:
  - question: Do you charge by an hour?
    answer: We avoid billing by the hour whenever possible. It creates ambiguity and
      makes you worry about your upcoming CPA bill. The only time we are billing
      by the hour is when we cannot reasonably estimate our time spend on a
      specific non-recurring project.
  - answer: "There are four main parts of Cannabis accounting: Bookkeeping+Cost
      Accounting+Local Taxes+Income Tax Corporation. With the first plan, you
      take care of bookkeeping and income tax preparation, and we help you with
      cost accounting and local taxes.  With the second plan, you use your
      bookkeeper, and we take care of cost accounting, local, and income taxes.
      With the third plan, we become your CFO and oversee all of the accounting
      functions. "
    question: What is the main difference between the plans?
  - question: How do you deliver sensitive information to clients?
    answer: "We are a paperless CPA firm that utilizes a secure client portal to
      exchange and deliver private information. "
