faqs:
  - question: Do you charge by an hour?
    answer: We avoid billing by the hour whenever possible. It creates ambiguity and
      makes you worry about your upcoming CPA bill. The only time we are billing
      by the hour is when we cannot reasonably estimate our time spend on a
      specific non-recurring project.
  - answer: "There are four main parts of Cannabis accounting: Bookkeeping+Cost
      Accounting+Local Taxes+Income Tax Corporation (IRS&FTB). With the first
      plan, you take care of bookkeeping and income tax preparation. With the
      second plan, you use your own bookkeeper, and we take care of everything
      else. With the third plan, we become your CFO. We take care of all your
      accounting functions, starting Bookkeeping, and ending Estimated Tax
      Payments."
