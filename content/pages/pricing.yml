faqs:
  - question: Do you charge by an hour?
    answer: We avoid billing by the hour whenever possible. It creates ambiguity and
      makes you worry about your upcoming CPA bill. The only time we are billing
      by the hour is when we cannot reasonably estimate our time spend on a
      specific non-recurring project.
  - answer: We will be more than happy to meet you in person if you are in San Diego
      area. If not, we can always Zoom and chat a little bit. California CPAs
      can be verified on the CBA website. You are welcome to look us up! We are
      in compliance =)
    question: Can I meet you in person? Afterall, you have my personal information!
  - question: How do you deliver sensitive information to clients?
    answer: We are paperless and virtual. We utilize a secure client portal to
      exchange and deliver private information. Client documents are
      encrypted  and stored on a secure server with two-factor authentication.
  - question: What else is included?
    answer: We value “all included” approach. For individuals, we offer free
      consultations during the year and tax planning at year end. For business
      clients we prepare quarterly estimated tax vouchers and look over their
      financials if requested. For our Cannabis clients, we prepare and file
      their monthly and quarterly local tax returns.
