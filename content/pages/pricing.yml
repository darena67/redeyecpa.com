faqs:
  - question: Do you charge by the hour?
    answer: We avoid billing by the hour whenever it’s possible. It creates
      ambiguity and makes you worry about your upcoming CPA bill. The only time
      we are billing by the hour is when we cannot reasonably estimate our time
      spend on a specific non-recurring project.
  - answer: " We will be more than happy to meet you in person if you are in San
      Diego area. If not, we try to set up Zoom meetings for all of our new
      customers. Also, California CPAs can be verified on the CBA website. You
      are welcome to look us up! We are in compliance. "
    question: Can I meet you in person? Afterall, you have my personal information!
  - question: How do you deliver sensitive information to clients?
    answer: We are paperless and virtual. We utilize a secure client portal to
      exchange and deliver private information. Client documents are
      encrypted  and stored on a secure server with two-factor authentication.
  - question: What else is included?
    answer: We believe in the “all included” approach. You are welcome to call us
      out of the blue, and we won’t charge for the conversation.
  - question: Can you give me a discount? I am broke.
    answer: "Our accounting fees are already pretty low compared to other cannabis
      CPA firms. However, we do give some discounts to microbusinesses due to
      the large amount of accounting work required. "
  - question: Can you prepare my 1040?
    answer: "Yes we can! However, please keep in mind that individual tax
      preparation is not included in our business plans offered above. "
  - question: Do you require a retainer?
    answer: We don’t ask for a retainer as long as you came to us from a different
      cannabis CPA firm. We trust our colleagues and believe in their accounting
      expertise. However, if prior to us you were doing your own accounting, or
      you are just starting out, we will ask for the retainer because of the
      amount of work that will be required to set up or clean up your
      accounting.
