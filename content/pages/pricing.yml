  - question: Do you charge by an hour?
    answer: We avoid billing by the hour whenever possible. It creates ambiguity and
      makes you worry about your upcoming CPA bill. The only time we are billing
      by the hour is when we cannot reasonably estimate our time spend on a
      specific non-recurring project.
