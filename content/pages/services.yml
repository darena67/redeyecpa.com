  - title: Bookkeeping
    subtitle: SMALL BUSINESSES, CANNABIS, AND HEMP COMPANIES
    desc: "Sometimes bookkeeping can get quite complicated. If you want those
      deductions on your tax return, you need to make sure that your accounting
      is GAAP compliant. Have you heard of such things as the Absorption method,
      Accrual accounting, and Lower of Cost or Market rule? If not, it's OK
      because we know what those mean, and we will make sure you are in
      compliance. "

  - title: Point of Sale Software
    subtitle: SET UP AND AUDIT OF TAX SETTINGS
    desc: "CDTFA wants its share of Excise and SUT tax. If you under collected, the
      agency will ask you to pay the missing tax out of pocket. If you
      over-collected, the agency will want this money too! As a dispensary, you
      collect those taxes through your Point of Sale System, and very often, its
      tax settings are incorrect. We help you set up your POS tax withholdings;
      this way, you do not pay a dime less or more in tax. "
