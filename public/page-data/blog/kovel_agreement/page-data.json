The IRS does not show up unexpectedly unless there is a criminal investigation. When they do show up, their main goal is to get an admission of guilt. The IRS wants to catch you off guard and make you hyperventilate.</p>\n<p>What do you do in this case? Call your CPA? Wrong!!!</p>\n<p>When it comes to criminal cases, there is no such thing as an accountant-client privilege. There is <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7525\">26 USC ยง 7525(a)</a>, but it protects only civil tax advice cases. If you call your CPA and say: \"Hey, the IRS was at my door, and I think I have a problem. I may have admitted some income items on the return.\" Just this small admission will get you in trouble. The CPA will be obliged to repeat your words to the IRS.</p>\n<p>There is a way around this problem, and it is called Kovel Agreement. By signing a Kovel letter, you shelter your communication with your CPA by involving an attorney. The attorney hires the CPA and treats him/her as they would an employee. This way, the attorney-client privilege is extended to the CPA. The CPA can now help you without being afraid that he will have to testify.</p>\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> This mechanism cannot be used to cloak prior communications. If you met with the accountant before retaining the attorney, your communication would not be protected by the attorney-client privilege. And vice versa, you can not use the Kovel agreement for communications about future criminal acts.</p>\n<p>The IRS does not look favorably upon these arrangements. But so far, it can work as long as the agreement is properly written.</p>\n<p>Daria</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"kovel_agreement","previous":{"frontmatter":{"title":"What entity should I choose for my Cannabis business?","path":"cannabis-entity-structure"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Test Blog 02","path":"testpath-2"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1090209129","3159585216"]}
